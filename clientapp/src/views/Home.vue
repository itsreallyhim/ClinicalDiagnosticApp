        <p class="mb-3">
            With the help of this clinical diagnostic assessment template, people with lower back and other musculo-skeletal pain
            (plus employers, insurers, medical, fitness and manipulative therapy practitioners) will be able to gain a clearer
            appreciation of the underlying cause of the pain and more accurately prescribe the mostappropriate rehab treatment -
            one that focuses on treating the underlying cause of the problem.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
            <span class="has-text-weight-semibold">As an individual</span> you can work your way through the clinical diagnostic
            assessment yourself - with the help of someone to take photos of you in various diagnostic postures.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
            We recommend you take the photos on a digital camera, smart phone or tablet. Crop the photos and then insert
            them in to the Clinical Diagnostic Assessment template - in the places as illustrated in this document.

            In the workplace, fitness centre, surgery or manipulative therapy rooms all it needs is someone to take people
            through the various assessments.

        <p class="mb-3">
            This document illustrates in detail the nature and scope of the assessment.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
            <span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Once you've signed up to complete the assessment</span> we'll send you
            the Microsoft Word version of the template that you can complete on your own computer and email to us for evaluation and recommendations
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
            The clinical diagnostic assessment comes with an <span class="has-text-weight-semibold">exercise prescription</span>
            that treats the cause of the problem by loosening tight muscles, strengthening weak muscles and getting the skeleton back into better alignment.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
            The exercise prescription is the most effective prescription there is for the treatment of most personally-generated
            musculo-skeletal dysfunctions. It's a prescription that people can administer themselves. In fact it's only they,
            themselves who can administer it. That's why it's the cheapest rehab program there is.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
            Most joint and muscle pain is personally generated. In the case of lower back pain, tight muscles attached to the
            pelvis have taken the pelvis and the bones above it out of alignment. Only on the rates of occasions is lower back
            pain caused by a lack of rubbing, crunching, heating, vibrating, strapping, doping, surgery, stretching gadgets ...!
        </p>

            (If you're a medical practitioner or rehab therapist you'll be able to use the template to quickly gain an appreciation
            of the strength, flexibility and skeletal alignment of your clients and provide them with an exercise prescription that they,
            themselves can use to become pain free.)
